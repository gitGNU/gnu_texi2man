Texi2man is a perl script. It extracts pieces of text from a file texinfo, recombines them into a new file and transcodes the result from texinfo to groff. With texi2man you can create a new man page in Unix style, extracting it from the source of a hypertext for info or for the web.

I'm still developing:
- the scripts to install and uninstall the program
- the texinfo source from which to obtain the manuals of texi2man (man pages, info files and web site)

EXAMPLE
This program has been used for the documentation of ZigzagDownLoader (ZDL):
https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/zdl
http://nongnu.org/zdl

The entire website and the 'man page' of ZDL are generated from the same texinfo source.
